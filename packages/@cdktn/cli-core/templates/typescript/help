  You can find all prebuilt providers on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:cdktf
  You can also install these providers directly through npm:

  npm install @cdktn/provider-aws
  npm install @cdktn/provider-google
  npm install @cdktn/provider-azurerm
  npm install @cdktn/provider-docker
  npm install @cdktn/provider-github
  npm install @cdktn/provider-null

  You can also build any module or provider locally. Learn more https://cdk.tf/modules-and-providers
